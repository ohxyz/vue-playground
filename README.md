# Basic setup of a Vue project

This is _NOT_ a npm package intended for installation. So do _NOT_ install it, e.g. by `npm i vue-setup`.

This is a basic setup of Vue with Babel and Webpack with plugins. If you don't like `Vue Cli`, it's probably the way you could go.

# Get started
Go to https://github.com/ohxyz/vue-setup

1. Create a folder e.g. `my-vue-project`.
2. Copy all<sup>[1]</sup> content of this repo into `my-vue-project`. _Tips:_ Click the green button `Clone or download` in this Github page and select `Download ZIP`.
3. Go to `my-vue-project`, run `npm i`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.

### Foot notes
[1] If you are not using Git, then don't copy `.gitignore`.
